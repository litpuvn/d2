							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Social media provides a significant
								communication
								platform for rescuing people when Harvey hits Houston area. In
								this devastating flooding crisis, the overloaded official emergency
								institutes are not able to respond quickly due to the burst of call
								for help in a very short period of time. In this circumstance, many
								volunteers and people who need help often post their information
								in social media such as Twitter and Facebook. How to organize
								volunteers smartly and efficiently to help people is an extremely
								challenging and significant problem considering the constraints
								of volunteer’s time slots, urgent priorities and etc. In this paper,

							<p>Long Hoang Nguyen, Andrew Salopek, Liang Zhao, Fang Jin</p>
							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Social media has become a popular data source
								to track and analyze societal events. Targeted domains such as
								election, civil unrest, and spreading disease all require a natural
								language normalization tool capable of extracting information
								pertinent to these domains accurately. Due to the unstructured
								language, short-length messages, casual posting style, and
								homonyms, it is technically difficult and labor-intensive to remove
								barriers that may lead to inaccurate analysis. Because the
								fact that typos or other symbolic representations of sentiment
								may lead to lower frequency of term appearance, language
								preprocessing becomes critical and necessary to improve social

						<div class="card-body">
							<p>Fang Jin, Wei Wang, Prithwish Chakraborty, Nathan Self, Feng Chen, Naren Ramakrishnan</p>
							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—The problem of modeling the continuously
								changing trends
								in finance markets and generating real-time, meaningful predictions
								about significant changes in those markets has drawn considerable interest
								from economists and data scientists alike. In addition to traditional
								market indicators, growth of varied social media has enabled economists
								to leverage micro- and real-time indicators about factors possibly influencing
								the market, such as public emotion, anticipations and behaviors.
								We propose several specific market related features that can be mined
								from varied sources such as news, Google search volumes and Twitter. We
								further investigate the correlation between these features and financial
								market fluctuations. In this paper, we present a Delta Naive Bayes (DNB)
								approach to generate prediction about financial markets. We present a
								detailed prospective analysis of prediction accuracy generated from multiple,
								combined sources with those generated from a single source. We
								find that multi-source predictions consistently outperform single-source
								predictions, even though with some limitations.</i></p>

						<h4 class="card-header">Absenteeism Detection in Social Media</h4>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>Fang Jin, Feng Chen, Rupinder Khandpur, Chang-Tien Lu, Naren Ramakrishnan</p>
							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Event detection in online social media has
								primarily focused
								on identifying abnormal spikes, or bursts, in activity.
								However, disruptive events such as socio-economic disasters,
								civil unrest, and even power outages, often involve abnormal
								troughs or lack of activity, leading to absenteeism. We
								present the first study, to our knowledge, that models absenteeism
								and uses detected absenteeism instances as a basis
								for event detection in location-based social networks such as
								Twitter. The proposed framework addresses the challenges
								of (i) early detection of absenteeism, (ii) identifying the locus
								of the absenteeism, and (iii) identifying groups or communities
								underlying the absenteeism. Our approach uses the
								formalism of graph wavelets to represent the spatiotemporal
								structure of user activity in a location-based social network.
								This formalism facilitates multiscale analysis, enabling us
								to detect anomalous behavior at different graph resolutions,
								which in turn allows the identification of event locations and
								underlying groups. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated
								using Twitter activity related to civil unrest events in
								Latin America.</i></p>

						<div class="card-body">
							<p>Fang Jin</p>
							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Online social networks have become a staging
								ground for many modern movements, with the
								Arab Spring being the most prominent example. In an effort to understand and predict
								those
								movements, social media can be regarded as a valuable social sensor for disclosing
								underlying
								behaviors and patterns. To fully understand mass movement information propagation
								patterns
								in social networks, several problems need to be considered and addressed. Specifically,
								modeling mass movements that incorporate multiple spaces, a dynamic network structure,
								and misinformation propagation, can be exceptionally useful in understanding information
								propagation in social media...</i></p>

							<p>Fang Jin, Rupinder Khandpur, Nathan Self, Edward Dougherty, Sheng Guo, Feng Chen, B.
								Aditya Prakash, Naren Ramakrishnan</p>
							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Modeling the movement of information within
								social media
								outlets, like Twitter, is key to understanding to how ideas
								spread but quantifying such movement runs into several dif-
								ficulties. Two specific areas that elude a clear characterization
								are (i) the intrinsic random nature of individuals to potentially
								adopt and subsequently broadcast a Twitter topic,
								and (ii) the dissemination of information via non-Twitter
								sources, such as news outlets and word of mouth, and its
								impact on Twitter propagation. These distinct yet interconnected
								areas must be incorporated to generate a comprehensive
								model of information diffusion. We propose a
								bispace model to capture propagation in the union of (exclusively)
								Twitter and non-Twitter environments. To quantify
								the stochastic nature of Twitter topic propagation, we
								combine principles of geometric Brownian motion and traditional
								network graph theory. We apply Poisson process functions
								to model information diffusion outside of the Twitter
								mentions network. We discuss techniques to unify the two
								sub-models to accurately model information dissemination.
								We demonstrate the novel application of these techniques
								on real Twitter datasets related to mass protest adoption in
								social communities.</i></p>

							<p class="card-text text-justify"><i>Abstract—Characterizing information diffusion on social

								media and model communication patterns. As Twitter
								gains in popularity, it has also become a venue to broadcast

								to characterize information cascades in twitter resulting

								enhanced epidemic model that explicitly recognizes skeptics
								to characterize eight events across the world and spanning
